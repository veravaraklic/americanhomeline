                        <p><strong>USAGE</strong></p>
                        <p>We may also use or share your information to protect the rights or property of American Home Line, our business partners, suppliers, clients, or others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>INFORMATION FOR BUSINESS PARTNERS &amp; SUPPLIERS</strong></p>
                        <p>If you are a business partner, supplier, vendor, agency or a third-party we may use information provided on our site(s) to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the business partner you represent generally.

                        <p><strong>SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION &amp; INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></p>
                        <p>American Home Line has business processes, management structures, and technical systems that cross borders. As such, we may share information about you within American Home Line and transfer it to countries around the world where we do business accordance with the uses identified above and with this Privacy Statement. Our Privacy Statement and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, American Home Line will still handle your information in the manner described here.</p>

It is American Home Line&#39;s practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with American Home Line&#39;s policies.</p>
                        <p>From time to time, we may disclose information that identifies you at an individual level and which we collected on our Web sites to other non-American Home Line &nbsp;entities that are not acting as our suppliers, such as our business partners. We do not sell or lease such information however.</p>
                        <p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, American Home Line&nbsp;decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is American Home Line&rsquo;s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>
                        <p>Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your information to protect the rights or property of American Home Line, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>INFORMATION SECURITY AND ACCURACY</strong></p>
